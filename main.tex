\subsection*{Overview of the topic}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
    \item Business as usual kills the planet so there is a need for energy transition
    % https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-and-climate-model/understanding-gec-model-scenarios
    \item As even announced pledged scenarios lead to overshooting the +1.5°C ambition, that energy transition will require drastic change of paradigms 
    \item Those changes of paradigms go through, depending on the papers/scientific literature, demand-side management, demand reduction, carbon capture, bioenergy
    \item Others consider nuclear or even electrofuels equivalent to fossil as a solution
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Prior research}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
    \item Give advantages and drawbacks of future nuclear
    \item Give advantages and drawbacks of electrofuels
    \item Compliqué de sortir du nucléaire car décision sur du long-terme (e.g. Belgique, France). C'est un choix politique. Comme il est aussi difficile de se-relancer dans cette aventure nucléaire
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Rationale for the paper}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{1em}
    \item Most of studies (\eg \cite{IEA_Nuclear_2019}) assess nuclear only within the power sector. Given the arguments of \citet{contino2020whole}, there is a need to consider whole-energy system model in this work.
    \item Some studies (\eg \cite{h2coalition}) only assesses the cost of purchasing without looking at the actual need
    \item Some studies only do snapshot
    \item

The structure of this paper is as follows. \Cref{sec:methodo} details the methodology followed in this work. After detailing the whole-energy system model, it gives further information on the uncertainty characterisation and quantification. \Cref{sec:case_study} presents the case study.

% 2 : Methodology
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodo}
The core of this section is, on the one hand, to introduce the model used in this analysis: EnergyScope Pathway \cite{limpens2023pathway} and, on the other hand, to introduce the framework that assesses the impact of uncertainties on the output of interest of the model (\eg total transition cost, amount of imported electrofuels or installed capacity of \gls{SMR}). To do so, the second part of this section focuses on the uncertainty characterisation developed by \citet{Moret2017} and the uncertainty quantification using \acrfull{PCE} \cite{Sudret2014}.

\subsection{EnergyScope Pathway}
\label{subsec:meth:ES_Pathway}
In a previous work, \citet{rixhon2021role} set different emission constraints on the snapshot model, \gls{ESTD} \cite{limpens2019energyscope}, for the target future year of 2050. On the contrary, this work optimises the entire transition pathway from a known system in 2020 up to 2050 thanks to EnergyScope Pathway \cite{limpens2023pathway}. According to pathway models review, EnergyScope Pathway can be categorised as an investment and operation optimisation model that assesses the whole-energy system, has a hourly time-resolution and is open-source documented model. Moreover, it maintains a low computational cost (\ie around 15 minutes for a 30-year pathway with a hourly discretisation). Presenting here only the main constraints of the model and the main input data in Section \ref{sec:case_study}, the reader is invited to refer to the extended paper \cite{limpens2023pathway} and the documentation \cite{readthedocs_pathway} for more extensive information.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

\caption{Illustration of the pathway methodology based on an existing energy system model. The methodology spans from 2020 to 2050, with one representative year every five years. The model \acrfull{ESTD} is applied in 7 representative years (light blue boxes). The formulation includes additional constraints (black boxes) that link the years together. The pathway's initialisation assumes that all capacities installed in 2020 were built during the pseudo-phase of 2015-2020 (grey box). The overall problem is defined as the pathway model. Graph adapted from \cite{limpens2023pathway}.}
\label{fig:meth_path_methodology}
\end{figure}

We used the perfect foresight (PF) formulation (\Cref{fig:meth_path_methodology})---the entire transition is computed in one optimisation, assuming a complete but uncertain knowledge of the different parameters until 2050. Even though this lacks realism compared to the myopic approach \cite{babrowski2014reducing,fais2016impact,heuberger2018impact} where the pathway is optimised via a sequence of shorter time windows, the perfect foresight approach allows to optimise the transition with a \ce{CO2}-budget (Section \ref{subsec:cs:CO2-budget}) rather than along a prescribed \ce{CO2}-trajectory. However, the work of \citet{limpens2023pathway} has shown that PF provides similar results for the study case compared to the myopic approach with a prescribed linear decrease of the \ce{CO2}-emissions . All the variables and constraints of the snapshot model, EnergyScope TD \cite{limpens2019energyscope}, are kept as is with an extra-dimension to relate them to a specific representative year, $y$, of the pathway. For instance, the energy balance is guaranteed at every hour of each of these years. 

The optimised objective of the pathway model, \ie the total transition cost $\textbf{C\textsubscript{tot,trans}}$, is computed as follows:

\hspace{0pt} \min \text{  } & \textbf{C\textsubscript{tot,trans}} = \textbf{C\textsubscript{tot,capex}} + \textbf{C\textsubscript{tot,opex}}&\\
\label{eq:CAPEX_v2}
& \textbf{C\textsubscript{tot,capex}} =
\sum_{\mathclap{p \in \text{\emph{PHASE}}\cup \{2015\_2020\}}} 
\textbf{C\textsubscript{inv,phase}}(p)
-
\sum_{\mathclap{j \in \emph{TECH}}} 
\textbf{C\textsubscript{inv,return}}(j)\\
  \label{eq:Copex_tot_v2}%5
& \textbf{C\textsubscript{tot,opex}} =  \textbf{C\textsubscript{opex}}(2020)
+ \emph{t\textsubscript{phase}}\cdot \tau\textsubscript{\emph{phase}}(p) \cdot \sum_{\mathclap{p \in \emph{PHASE}|y\textsubscript{start}\in \emph{P\_START}(p),y\textsubscript{stop}\in \emph{P\_STOP}(p)}} 
 \Big(\textbf{C\textsubscript{opex}}(y\textsubscript{start}) + \textbf{C\textsubscript{opex}}(y\textsubscript{stop}) \Big)/2&\\
\label{eq:path_annu_factor}
& \tau\textsubscript{\emph{phase}}(p) = 1/(1+\emph{i\textsubscript{rate}})^{\emph{diff\_2015\_year(p)}} &
%% GL_correction_v2 %% & \tau\textsubscript{\emph{phase}}(p) = 1/(1+\emph{i\textsubscript{rate}})^{\emph{diff\_2015\_year(p)}} &
\end{flalign}
\endgroup

\noindent
where $\emph{t\textsubscript{phase}}=5\,\text{years}$ and $\emph{diff\_2015\_year(p)}$ are respectively the duration of a phase between two representative years and the number of years between the middle of a phase and 2015 for a correct annualisation. $\textbf{C\textsubscript{inv,return}}$ accounts for the residual value, also called \textit{salvage value}, of the technologies installed during the transition and having not reached the end of their lifetime by 2050. This last variable is crucial to avoid penalising heavy (and potentially long-lifetime) investments at the end of the transition as these assets would still be operational beyond 2050. The interested reader will find more information about its implementation and the formulation choices related to it in the work of \citet{limpens2023pathway}. The other variables in Eq.\,(\ref{eq:CAPEX_v2}-\ref{eq:Copex_tot_v2}) are detailed here below:

\begingroup
\belowdisplayskip=2pt
\abovedisplayskip=2pt
\begin{flalign} 
\label{eq:opex_yearly}
&\textbf{C\textsubscript{opex}} (y) = \sum_{\mathclap{j \in \emph{TECH}}} \textbf{C\textsubscript{maint}}(y,j) + \sum_{\mathclap{i \in \emph{RES}}} \textbf{C\textsubscript{op}}(y,i)&\forall y\in \emph{YEARS}\\
\label{eq:PhaseInv}%5
&\textbf{C\textsubscript{inv,phase}}(p) = \sum_{\mathclap{j \in \emph{TECH}}} \textbf{F\textsubscript{new}}(p,j)\cdot \tau\textsubscript{\emph{phase}}(p)\cdot \left(\emph{c\textsubscript{inv}}(\emph{y\textsubscript{start}},j) + \emph{c\textsubscript{inv}}(\emph{y\textsubscript{stop}},j)\right)/2&\notag\nonumber
\end{flalign}
\begin{flalign}
&&\forall p \in \emph{PHASE} | y\textsubscript{start}\in \emph{P\_START}(p),y\textsubscript{stop}\in \emph{P\_STOP}(p)
\end{flalign}
\endgroup

\noindent
where $\textbf{F\textsubscript{new}}$ are the capacities newly installed. In Eq. (\ref{eq:opex_yearly}-\ref{eq:PhaseInv}), the costs related to each representative year are:

\begingroup
\belowdisplayskip=2pt
\abovedisplayskip=2pt
\begin{flalign} 
% Objective function + investment 
% adding 25pt space, otherwise flalign with two "&" would flush to the extreme left
\hspace{0pt} 
 \label{eq:c_inv}%3
 &\textbf{C\textsubscript{inv}}(y,j) = c_{\text{\emph{inv}}}(y,j) \textbf{F}(y,j) & \forall y \in \text{\emph{YEARS}}, \forall j \in \text{\emph{TECH}}\\
 \label{eq:c_maint}%4
 &\textbf{C\textsubscript{maint}}(y,j) = c_{\text{\emph{maint}}}(y,j) \textbf{F}(y,j) & \forall y \in \text{\emph{YEARS}}, \forall j \in \text{\emph{TECH}}\\ 
  \label{eq:c_op}%5
 &\textbf{C\textsubscript{op}}(y,i) = \sum_{\mathclap{t \in T }} c_{\text{\emph{op}}}(y,i) \textbf{F\textsubscript{t}}(y,i,t) t_{op} (t)  
 & \forall y \in \text{\emph{YEARS}}, \forall i \in \text{\emph{RES}}
 \end{flalign}
 \endgroup

\noindent where the variable $\textbf{F}$ represents the size of the installed capacities (for all technologies $j$) and the variable $\textbf{F\textsubscript{t}}$ is the hourly consumption of the resources; the parameters $c_{\text{\emph{inv}}}$ and $c_{\text{\emph{maint}}}$ are the CAPEX and the OPEX of the technologies, and the parameter $c_{\text{\emph{op}}}$ is the cost of purchasing resources. For the sake of simplicity, as done by \citet{limpens2023pathway}, the sum over the 8760 hours of the year is written as the sum over $t \in T $. 

Then, as detailed in section \ref{subsec:cs:CO2-budget}, the \ce{CO2}-budget for the transition, $\textbf{GWP\textsubscript{tot,trans}}$, is computed and constrained as follows:

\begingroup
\belowdisplayskip=2pt
\abovedisplayskip=2pt
\begin{flalign} 
\label{eq:gwp_tot_transition}
&\textbf{GWP\textsubscript{tot,trans}}= \textbf{GWP\textsubscript{tot}}(2020) + \emph{t\textsubscript{phase}}\sum_{\mathclap{p \in \emph{PHASE}|y\textsubscript{start}\in \emph{Y\_START}(p),y\textsubscript{stop}\in \emph{Y\_STOP}(p)}}\left(\textbf{GWP\textsubscript{tot}}(y\textsubscript{start}) +\textbf{GWP\textsubscript{tot}}(y\textsubscript{stop}) \right)/2 &
\\
\label{eq:limit_gwp_trans}
& \textbf{GWP\textsubscript{tot,trans}} \leq \emph{gwp\textsubscript{lim,trans}}&
\end{flalign}
\endgroup

\noindent
where the computation of the yearly emissions are based on the \acrfull{GWP} of the resources:

\begingroup
\belowdisplayskip=2pt
\abovedisplayskip=2pt
\begin{flalign}
\hspace{0pt}
 \label{eq:GWP_tot}%8
 & \textbf{GWP\textsubscript{tot}}(y)  =    \sum_{\mathclap{i \in \text{\emph{RES}}}} \textbf{GWP\textsubscript{op}}(y,i) 
 & \forall y \in \text{\emph{YEARS}}\\
  \label{eq:GWP_op}%7
 & \textbf{GWP\textsubscript{op}}(y,i) = \sum_{\mathclap{t \in T }} gwp_{\text{\emph{op}}}(y,i) \textbf{F\textsubscript{t}}(y,i,t)  t_{op} (t) & \forall y \in \text{\emph{YEARS}}, \forall i \in \text{\emph{RES}}
\end{flalign}
\endgroup

\noindent
where $gwp_{\text{\emph{op}}}$ is the specific emissions (\ie in kt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/GWh) of each resource. Based on an approach developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \cite{stocker2014climate}, this work considers the indicator ``GWP100a - IPCC2013'' to compute the emissions related to the use of resources. This includes the emissions due to the extraction, the transportation and the combustion of the energy carrier. EnergyScope proposes to account for the embodied emissions of the technologies based on a \gls{LCA}. These stand for extraction of materials, refining, construction and end of life \cite{schnidrig2023integration}. However, this work is still in progress and the database is not yet complete. Consequently, it is not included in this work and not accounted for.

Besides this constraint on the emissions, the main constraint to link years with each other is the one dictating the installed capacities at the end of each year:

\begingroup
\belowdisplayskip=2pt
\abovedisplayskip=2pt
\begin{flalign} 
\label{eq:F_newBuilt}%5
&\textbf{F}(y\textsubscript{stop},j) = \textbf{F}(y\textsubscript{start},j)
 + \textbf{F\textsubscript{new}}(p,j)
 - \textbf{F\textsubscript{old}}(p,j)
 - \sum_{\mathclap{p2 \in \text{\emph{PHASE}} \cup \{2015\_2020\}}} \textbf{F\textsubscript{decom}}(p,p2,j)& \notag \nonumber 
 \end{flalign}
\begin{flalign} 
 &&  \forall p \in \text{\emph{PHASE}}, \emph{y\textsubscript{stop}} \in \emph{Y\_STOP}(p), \emph{y\textsubscript{start}} \in \emph{Y\_START}(p), j \in \text{\emph{TECH}}
 \end{flalign}
\endgroup

\noindent
where the variables $\textbf{F\textsubscript{old}}$ and $\textbf{F\textsubscript{decom}}$ are the capacities respectively having reached the end of their lifetime and prematurely decommissioned. Moreover, to account for the society inertia and to prevent unrealistically fast modal share change, constraints limit this change for the sectors of the low-temperature, the passenger mobility and freight mobility demands. The parameters $\Delta_{\mathrm{change,LT\_heat}}$, $\Delta_{\mathrm{change,pass}}$ and $\Delta_{\mathrm{change,freight}}$ respectively limit their respective modal share change up to 33\%, 50\% and 50\% per phase of 5 years.

\subsection{Uncertainty quantification}
\label{subsec:meth:UQ}
In their systematic review, \citet{yue2018review} highlighted that a wide majority of studies addressing the optimisation of energy systems (\ie 75\% out of the 134 reviewed studies) were not investigating the impact of uncertainties. However, disregarding these impacts can have drastic consequences on the system design. For instance, historical low \gls{NG} prices have led to overcapacity of \gls{CCGT} in Europe \cite{moret2020overcapacity}. This is why accounting for uncertainty in \gls{ESOMs} is crucial \cite{mavromatidis2018uncertainty}, especially when it comes to optimise several decades in an inherently uncertain future \cite{peace2008insights}.

This section aims at briefly presenting the methods followed to first characterise these uncertainties, then to quantify their impact on different outputs of interest of the model (\eg amount of molecules imported from abroad, the installed capacity of \gls{SMR} or the total transition cost) and finally, the screening and selection of the parameters to analyse.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty characterisation and sampling}
\label{subsubsec:UQ:UC}
Characterising precisely the uncertainty---ideally with their respective probability density functions (PDFs)---of the thousands of parameters in the model is daunting if not impossible because of lack of data \cite{marnay2006addressing}. Therefore, we used a workaround developed by \citet{Moret2017} that defines relative ranges of variation for different groups of parameters. These ranges have been adapted for the Belgian energy system and the pathway formulation. Moreover, some ranges have been added to account for new parameters coming from the pathway formulation described in \Cref{subsec:meth:ES_Pathway} like the society inertia.

\Cref{tab:UC_short} gives the uncertainty ranges of some key parameters. Like other works \cite{li2019renewables,coppitters2021robust}, the uncertain parameters are assumed to be independent and uniformly distributed between their respective lower and upper bounds. A particular attention is to pay to the potential installation of \gls{SMR}, at the bottom of \Cref{tab:UC_short}. As detailed in \Cref{sec:case_study}, the commercial availability of such a technology is uncertain but would not be before 2040. Consequently, for \gls{SMR}, the parameter $f_{\mathrm{max,SMR}}$ influences the maximum capacity to install to translate somehow the readiness of this technology. As SMRs are foreseen, if installed, to be around the same locations (\ie Tihange and Doel) as the conventional nuclear power plants and using the same area in kW/ha, the same 6\,GW are assumed to be the maximum capacity for SMRs. If it is (i) smaller than 0.6, there is no possibility to install \gls{SMR} during the transition; (ii) between 0.6 and 0.8, these 6~GW can be installed only in 2050; (iii) between 0.8 and 0.9, these can be installed from 2045 onward and; (iv) higher than 0.9, the prescribed maximum capacity can be installed from 2040 onward. Based on the local sensitivity analysis carried out by \citet{PATHS2050}, the current work also considers a [-40\%; +44\%] range on the CAPEX of SMR, on top of the uncertainty about the availability. Finally, the the cost of purchasing renewable electrofuels presents a wide range, [-64.3\%; +179.8\%], like the other imported commodities.

The exhaustive list of the parameters accounted in this work is presented in Appendix \ref{app:UC_full}.

Following the methodology defined by \citet{Moret2017}, uncertainties of types I (investment-type) and II (operation-type, constant uncertainty over time) keep the same range for the whole transition. However, parameters with an uncertainty increasing over time, type III, (\ie end-use demands, in this case) will have a wider and wider range over the transition. In this work, a +50\% linear increase has been arbitrarily set between the width of the range of such parameters in 2025 and the same ranges in 2050. In \Cref{fig:ranges_transition}, this means that for type III uncertainties only, $R_{2050}^+$ is 50\% bigger than $R_{2025}^+$ and $R_{2050}^-$ is 50\% smaller than $R_{2025}^-$. For uncertainties of types I and II, the relative variation versus the nominal value remain the same over the transition. Inspired by \citet{guevara2022modeling}, the values of the uncertain parameters are set at a fixed relative position from the nominal values for each sampled transition---the values do not zigzag from 2025 to 2050 within the bounds (\Cref{fig:ranges_transition}).

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/ranges_transition.pdf}
\caption{$\mu_{2020}$, $\mu_{2025}$, ...,  $\mu_{2050}$ are the nominal values equal to 0 as the uncertain parameters represent a relative increase/decrease of actual parameters of the model. $R^+$ and $R^-$ are respectively the upper and lower bounds of the range and $\xi_{2025}$, $\xi_{2030}$, ...,  $\xi_{2050}$ are the values taken by one parameter for a specific sample of the \gls{GSA} for each of the representative years of the transition, always starting from the nominal value in 2020, $\mu_{2020}$. The graph has been adapted from \cite{guevara2022modeling}.}
\label{fig:ranges_transition}
\end{figure}

Finally, the model accounts for thousands of parameters. The computational burden to consider all of them separately would be completely overwhelming ($\sim 10^7$ model runs). Therefore, similarly to other works \cite{Moret2017,limpens2020impact}, the model parameters that would follow the same uncertainty have been grouped to one single uncertain parameter. For instance, the uncertainty on the cost of purchasing renewable electrofuels, $c_{\mathrm{op,electrofuels}}$, identically affects the cost of e-hydrogen, e-methane, e-ammonia and e-methanol. Indeed, besides their respective specificities, each of these fuels will be similarly affected by the variation of cost of electricity or the electrolyser, that drive the majority of their cost of purchasing \cite{h2coalition}. Similarly, the uncertainties impacting the industrial demand, $industry\_EUD$, alters equally the industrial high- and low-temperature and electricity demands as well as the non-energy demand.

\subsubsection{Polynomial Chaos Expansion}
\label{subsubsec:UQ:PCE}
We used \gls{PCE}, an approach for surrogate-assisted \gls{UQ}, to propagate uncertainties in input parameters through the system model. This allowed us to assess statistical moments on the quantity of interest and determine Sobol' indices~\cite{coppitters2020robust}. To construct a PCE of the EnergyScope Pathway model, we employed the open-source Python framework RHEIA~\cite{coppitters2022rheia,readthedocs_rheia}.\par

The PCE model ($\hat{M}$) is a representation of the relationship between the input parameters and the output variable of interest (\ie results) in the EnergyScope Pathway model ($M$). This representation is constructed as a truncated series of multivariate orthonormal polynomials $\bm{\Psi}$, weighted by coefficients $u$:

\begin{equation}
\hat{M} \left( \bm{\xi} \right) = \sum_{\bm{\alpha} \in \mathcal{A}^{d,p}} u_{\bm{\alpha}} \bm{\Psi}_{\bm{\alpha}} \left( \bm{\xi} \right) \approx M \left( \bm{\xi} \right), 
\end{equation}

where the vector $\bm{\xi} = (\xi_1,\xi_2, \dots \xi_d)$ comprises the independent random input parameters (\autoref{app:UC_full}), $d$ corresponds to the number of input distributions and $\bm{\alpha}$ is a multi-index, \ie a vector of non-negative indices of length $d$, where each index corresponds to the degree of each univariate polynomial that forms the basis of the multivariate polynomial $\bm{\Psi_{\bm{\alpha}}}$. As uniform distributions are considered, the Legendre polynomials are adopted, as they are the associated family of polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to standard uniform distributions~\cite{Sudret2014}.\par 

A truncation scheme is implemented to restrict the number of multivariate polynomials in the series. This is done based on two factors: a specified limiting polynomial order ($p$) and the number of uncertain parameters ($d$) involved. The multivariate polynomial order $|\bm{\alpha}|$ is the summation of the orders for each univariate polynomial in the multivariate polynomials space. Thus, only the multi-indices corresponding to an order that is less than or equal to the specified limiting order are retained and stored in the truncated series denoted as $\mathcal{A}^{d,p}$:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A}^{d,p} = \left \{ \bm{\alpha} \in \mathbb{N}^d : |\bm{\alpha}| \leq p \right \}. 
\end{equation}

The number of multi-indices satisfying this condition is as the cardinality of $\mathcal{A}$, \ie the number of its elements:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{card} \left( \mathcal{A}^{d,p} \right) = {p + d \choose p} = \dfrac{\left( d + p \right) !}{d! p!} = P + 1.
\label{eq:pce:nterms}
\end{equation}

The coefficients ($u_0, u_1, \dots, u_{P+1}$) are quantified using a regression method applied to orthonormal polynomials~\cite{Sudret2014}. To ensure a well-posed least-square minimisation, it is recommended to have a number of training samples at least twice the number of coefficients~\cite{Sudret2014}. Therefore, $2 \left( P+1 \right)$ samples are evaluated in the system model, and the model response for each quantity of interest is recorded. To generate the training samples, the quasi-random Sobol' sampling technique is employed~\cite{bratley2003implementing}. As a low-discrepancy sequence, this technique exhibits the main advantage to investigate efficiently and (almost) uniformly the hypercube of uncertainties, unlike uniformly distributed random numbers.\par

The process of defining the polynomial degree includes incrementally increasing it until a desired level of accuracy is achieved~\cite{coppitters2022rheia}. Starting with $p=1$, a PCE is constructed and the \gls{LOO} error is evaluated. If the \gls{LOO} error is below a specified threshold, the corresponding polynomial order is considered sufficient for generating an accurate PCE. However, if the error exceeds the threshold, the order is increased, and additional samples are generated following the rule of Eq.\,(\ref{eq:pce:nterms}).

For the specific study of this work, a polynomial order of 2 is necessary (with 1260 training samples as per Eq.\,(\ref{eq:pce:nterms})) to achieve a \gls{LOO} error below \SI{1}{\%} for the total transition cost.\par

Lastly, the statistical moments can be analytically derived from the PCE coefficients, eliminating the need for further model evaluations. The mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ are obtained as follows:
\begin{align}
\mu &= u_0,\\
\sigma^2 &= \sum_{i \neq 0 } u_{i}^2 .
\label{eq:pce:statmom}
\end{align}

Furthermore, the Sobol' indices can also be determined analytically. The total-order Sobol' indices ($S_i^{T}$) assess the overall influence of a stochastic input parameter on the performance indicator, encompassing all possible interactions:

\begin{equation}
S_i^{T} = \sum_{\bm{\alpha} \in A_i^T}^{} u_{\bm{\alpha}}^2/\sum_{i=1}^P u_i^2 ~~~~~~ A_i^T = \{\bm{\alpha} \in A | \alpha_i > 0\}.
\end{equation}

Here, $A$ denotes the collection of all PCE coefficients, and $\alpha_i$ corresponds to the coefficient associated with the uncertain parameter $i$.\par

\subsubsection{Preliminary grouping, screening and selection}
\label{subsubsec:UQ:screening}
After the initial phase of grouping (Section \ref{subsubsec:UQ:UC}), a preliminary screening was necessary to identify the key parameters to account for in this \gls{GSA}. \citet{rixhon2021role} performed a similar sensitivity analysis on the 2050 Belgian whole-energy system under different \ce{CO2}-limits using a snapshot model (\ie EnergyScope TD \cite{limpens2019energyscope}). Screening the results of this work, we have discarded some parameters with negligigble impact (\eg CAPEX of electrolysers or variation of the freight demand), selected a subset of parameters and added others that were intrinsic to the pathway formulation, \eg modal share changes, or related to the integration of \gls{SMR}, $f_{\mathrm{max,SMR}}$. The exhaustive list of these 34 parameters is presented in Appendix \ref{app:UC_full}.

\section{Case study: the Belgian whole-energy system}
\label{sec:case_study}
As detailed by \citet{limpens2023pathway}, the analysis carried out in this work can be applied to any regional whole-energy system. As a densely-populated and highly-industrialised country with limited local renewable potentials (mainly solar and wind), the transition of Belgium from a fossil-dominated system in 2020 (Appendix \ref{sec:app:bel_2020}) to carbon-neutrality in 2050 makes it an intricate case study. Moreover, this case study and the subsequent analyses can be transferred - to some extent - to other industrialised countries highly dependent on fossil fuels with limited local renewable potentials (\eg the Netherlands or Germany) \cite{dommisse2020modelling}. This section presents the different demands to satisfy as well as the resources available and the conversion technologies to supply those. The focus here is given to the renewable molecules to import from abroad as well as the techno-economic details of \gls{SMR}. For a comprehensive understanding and detailed descriptions of the technologies, please refer to the documentation \cite{readthedocs_pathway}. Finally, the \ce{CO2}-budget over the 2020-2050 transition is presented.


\subsection{Demands}
\label{subsec:cs:demand}

End-use demands, exogenously imposed as inputs to the model, are characterised by yearly quantities to satisfy and are also distributed over the different hours of each representative years of the transition, in order to account for their daily or seasonal variability. In this work, the yearly end-use demands (EUD) for all sectors are calculated from the rather slightly increasing forecast proposed by the European Commission for Belgium (Appendix 2 in report \cite{EuropeanCommission2021}). Although, given a significant and unsubstantiated discrepancy in the non-energy use forecasts compared to their previous report (\ie +80\% over the 2020-2030 time window), the evolution trend of the \gls{NED} of the current work has been inferred from the previous edition, published in 2016, \cite{EuropeanCommission2016}. Looking at \Cref{fig:cs_demands}, between 2020 and 2050, one observes a noteworthy increase of the electricity (+40\%), passenger (+45\%) and freight mobility (+35\%) demands. The rise of the non-energy demand is more limited, \ie +6\%, whereas the heating demands is forecast to decrease: -11\% and -3\% respectively for the low and high-temperature heat demands. Regarding the center graph of \Cref{fig:cs_demands}, it is the aggregation of the same data as in the left graph but per category, rather than per sector, with the non-energy demand being associated with the industry. This illustrates how industrialised is Belgium, compared to households and services, and, consequently, highly energy-intensive. The right graph of \Cref{fig:cs_demands} gives the passenger and the freight mobility. The sharp increase from 2020 to 2025 is due the COVID-crisis that has significantly reduced these demands in 2020. As far as the hourly discretisation of these demands is concerned, time series are based on historical values of 2015 for parts of electricity and low-temperature heating demands \cite{Limpens2020}. A daily time series is used for the passenger mobility and applied similarly to every typical days. Finally, for the other demands, the yearly demand is distributed uniformly over the different hours of the year.

\caption{EnergyScope splits the whole-energy system end-use demands (EUD) into two sets: (non)-energy and transport-related. This figure presents the nominal values of each of these demands. In the center graph, the non-energy demand has been fully associated with the industrial demand. As detailed by \citet{rixhon2022integration}, the non-energy demand is expressed in tons of physical products (\ie \acrfull{HVC}, ammonia and methanol) and then translated into their respective energy equivalent, in TWh. Graphs have been adapted from \cite{limpens2023pathway}.}
\label{fig:cs_demands}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Resources}
\label{subsec:cs:resources}
To supply the aforementioned demands, EnergyScope Pathway implements a variety of resources defined by their cost of purchasing, $\mathit{c}_{\mathrm{op}}$, their global warming potential, $\mathit{gwp}_{\mathrm{op}}$, as well as their 
availability, as detailed by \citet{limpens2023pathway}. \Cref{fig:cs_resources_cost} depicts the evolution the respective costs of purchasing. Regarding ``renewable electrofuels'', these are in line with the recent study of \citet{genge2023supply} who carried out an extensive review and ``meta-analysis\cite{grant2009typology,page2021prisma} of 30 studies on the supply costs of chemical energy carriers''. Then, besides their cost, the resources are either limited or unlimited in terms of availability and either renewable or not. The limitation in terms of availability can be direct or indirect. On the one hand, woody (23.4\,TWh) and wet biomass (38.9\,TWh) are limited by their local potentials and the consumption of waste (17.8\,TWh) and coal (33.4\,TWh) is assumed not to exceed the current use. On the other hand, wind, solar, hydro and uranium are limited by the technical potentials respectively, of \gls{PV} panels (59.2\,GW), onshore (10\,GW) and offshore (6\,GW) wind turbines, run-of-the-river power plants (0.1\,GW) and nuclear power plants (6\,GW). As \gls{SMR} are foreseen, if installed, to be around the same locations (\ie Thiange and Doel) as the conventional nuclear power plants and using the same area in kW/ha, the same 6\,GW are assumed to be the maximum capacity for \gls{SMR}. This is even without considering the potential limit due to the local availability, in terms of volume and flow rate, of enough water that would be a more socially-accepted solution than cooling towers exhausting a dense plume. Imported electricity is limited in two ways: the potential of instantaneous capacity of interconnection with neighbouring countries (\ie 11.9\,GW by 2050 \cite{ELIA_2050}) and a limitation to 30\% of the yearly electricity end-use demand (\ie 32.4\,TWh by 2050). In the current work, the electrofuels (\ie e-methane, e-hydrogen, e-methanol and e-ammonia) are assumed to be ``sustainable" in the sense that they do not increase the concentration of \ce{CO2} in the atmosphere \cite{rixhon2021terminology}. In practice, it means that their \gls{GWP} is assumed to be zero in the model. Regarding specifically these electrofuels, the \citet{h2coalition} has carried out an extensive techno-economic analysis to estimate their respective cost of purchasing, after having identified some key locations from which importing these energy carriers (\eg Chile, Australia or Morocco). As the amount to import from each of these locations is hard to forecast, the current work considers the average cost between the different locations. Besides these, every other resource has its specific \gls{GWP} like coal ($\mathit{gwp}_{\mathrm{op,coal}}=0.40$\,kt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/GWh), natural gas ($\mathit{gwp}_{\mathrm{op,NG}}=0.27$\,kt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/GWh) or the fossil-based molecules equivalent to the electrofuels (\eg $\mathit{gwp}_{\mathrm{op,ammonia}}=0.46$\,kt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/GWh or $\mathit{gwp}_{\mathrm{op,methanol}}=0.41$\,kt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/GWh).

Besides the free local renewables (\ie sun, wind and hydro) limited by technical potentials, EnergyScope accounts for renewable energy carriers and their respective fossil counterparts (left and center graphs).

Other carriers are limited either by their local potentials (\ie biomass and waste) or other considerations like the power grid interconnections or the capacity of nuclear power plants.}
\label{fig:cs_resources_cost}
\end{figure}


\subsection{SMR and other conversion technologies}
\label{subsec:cs:technologies}
Finally, as the end-use demands are defined as energy (and non-energy with the \gls{NED}) services rather than a certain quantity of oil or solar irradiance, technologies are implemented to convert these resources into the end-use demands. Besides their CAPEX, OPEX and lifetime defined in Section \ref{subsec:meth:ES_Pathway}, production and conversion technologies (\ie \gls{CCGT}, car or boiler) have a conversion efficiency whereas storage technologies (\ie thermal storage, battery or molecule storage) exhibit their own charge/discharge losses. Eventually, there are also infrastructure technologies like the grid or the \gls{DHN} that allow to account for the investment necessary, respectively, to integrate more intermittent renewables in the power sector and the expand the use of centralised heating systems.

A specific attention is to put on the implementation of \acrfull{SMR} whereas the 6\,GW of conventional nuclear are assumed to drop to 2\,GW in 2025 and total phase-out by 2035. Similarly to the analysis of \citet{PATHS2050}, a Belgian consortium for energy research, and in line with the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre (SCK-CEN) \cite{SCK-CEN_SMR}, \gls{SMR} are implemented with the features listed in \Cref{tab:SMR_features}. Where most of the features are similar to conventional nuclear power plants, it differs from these on two main points: their potential year start, 2040, and their flexibility. Indeed, unlike the current nuclear power plants, constrained in the model to produce a constant power output at every hour of the year (\ie baseload production as it is actually the case in Belgium), SMRs, are flexible in the sense that their production can vary between 0 and their full capacity independently at any hour of each representative year. Here, the authors simplify SMRs as only producing electricity and assume that the after-heat is lost to the atmosphere anyway.


\begin{table}[htbp!]
\caption{Nominal features of the SMRs in EnergyScope. \gls{SMR} exhibits the advantage to have a fully flexible production (\ie between 0 to the full capacity) unlike conventional nuclear that is constrained to produce a constant baseload at every hour of the year. $^{(a)}$ This annual availability accounts for yearly maintenance where the reactors might not operate or, at least, not at their maximum capacity. $^{(b)}$ 2040 is the soonest year at which \gls{SMR} could be available, optimistically assuming industrial prototypes being completed by 2035 and 5 additional years for their commercial installation.}

For the sake of comparison, \Cref{fig:LCOE} gives the \gls{LCOE} of the principal technologies to produce electricity, based on the computation used by \citet{limpens2021generating}. Compared to the other flexible generation units, \gls{SMR} is significantly more cost-effective. In addition, we see that \gls{CCGT} supplied by e-ammonia outcompetes its e-methane equivalent, unlike their respective fossil-based equivalent.

\end{figure}

\subsection{\ce{CO2}-budget for the transition}
\label{subsec:cs:CO2-budget}
In most of the studies carried out on the pathway optimisation of a whole-energy system, a \ce{CO2}-trajectory is \textit{a priori} set to reach carbon-neutrality by 2050. \citet{nerini2017myopic} used the emission trajectory indicated by the UK's Committee on Climate Change in their analysis of the impact of limited foresight to achieve the target of 80\% reduction of \gls{GHG} by 2050 in the United Kingdom. In their assessment of the impacts of economy-wide emissions policies in the water-energy-land nexus, \citet{licandeo2023assessing} analysed different \ce{CO2}-trajectories considering more or less severe water scarcity for the US. \citet{poncelet2016myopic} with LUSYM (Leuven University SYstem Model) and \citet{PATHS2050} with TIMES-BE also set decreasing emission trajectories in their analysis of respectively the Belgian power sector and whole-energy system.  Others only set the objective as the carbon-neutrality by 2050. For instance, \citet{heuberger2018impact} investigated the impact of different factors (\eg limit of the foresight in the future, availability of ``unicorn technologies'' or committed versus market-driven decarbonisation strategies) to reach this ultimate objective in the UK system.

In this work, the effect of greenhouse gases is cumulative over time and a constraint is set on the overall emissions of the transition---a \ce{CO2}-budget for the transition. This budget (1.2\,Gt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$) corresponds to the proportion of Belgium's emissions in the world emissions in 2020 (34.8\,Gt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$ \cite{ourworldindata_CO2_world}) applied to the global budget to have a 66\% chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C of 420\,Gt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$ \cite{IPCC_CO2_budget}. Therefore, in this work, a limit has been put on $\emph{gwp\textsubscript{lim,trans}}=1.2\,\text{Gt}_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$ in
Eq.\,(\ref{eq:limit_gwp_trans}). This is another sign of the urgency to act to mitigate climate change as this 30-year budget represents only 10 years of the current emissions. Compared to a linear decrease from the current emissions, as done by \citet{limpens2023pathway}, this budget represents a 60\% reduction of the cumulative emissions over the transition. Appendix \ref{app:CO2} compares the emissions trajectory between the REF case and a case (without \gls{SMR}) where the linear decrease is imposed between 2020 and carbon-neutrality in 2050.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
The model and the frameworks have been introduced in \cref{sec:methodo} and the case study presented in \cref{sec:case_study}. This section focuses on the results in two ways. First, Section \ref{subsec:results_deter} targets the impact of integrating \gls{SMR} from 2040 onward on the whole-energy system, in a deterministic way (\ie considering only nominal values of the parameters). Second, accounting for uncertainties as presented in section \ref{subsec:meth:UQ}, section \ref{subsec:results_uq} will identify the key factors driving higher or lower imports of electrofuels as well as the installation of \gls{SMR}. 

\subsection{Deterministic impact of integrating \gls{SMR} in 2040}
\label{subsec:results_deter} 
In this section, like in the rest of the paper, the \textbf{REF} case is without any deployment of \gls{SMR} anytime during the transition and whereas in the \textbf{SMR} case this technology is available, up to 6\,GW, from 2040 onward. After investigating the deployment of \gls{SMR} through the power sector, the first part of this section focuses on this impact on macro/system-level considerations (\ie overall transition costs, primary energy mix and yearly emissions per sector). The second part will address the impact of \gls{SMR} on each of the other sectors of the system.

\subsubsection{Power sector}
\label{subsubsec:results_deter_power_sector}
\Cref{fig:results_deter_tech_cap_elec} shows that \gls{SMR} is deployed as soon as available, \ie 2040, to their maximum capacity, \ie 6\,GW, substituting other flexible power generation units: no ammonia-\gls{CCGT} at the end of the transition and the anticipatory reduction of methane \gls{CCGT} (\ie 2.1\,GW in 2040 versus 3.7\,GW for the REF case). To a lesser extent, the last 2\% deployment of solar-\gls{PV} is slightly delayed as the capacity in 2025 is 1.3\,GW smaller than in the REF case. Overall, given the smaller efficiency of \gls{SMR}, \ie 40\% versus 51\% for ammonia-\gls{CCGT}, the restriction on yearly availability and the slightly higher electrification (\Cref{fig:results_deter_layer_elec}), the total power capacity installed by 2050 is 3.5\% higher for the SMR case.

\label{fig:results_deter_tech_cap_elec}
\end{figure}

When assessing the electricity production-versus-consumption-balance (\Cref{fig:results_deter_layer_elec}), \gls{SMR}, as a cheaper, flexible and low-emitting power generation system, produces to its full capacity, given the 15\% maintenance off-time assumed in this work: 44.6\,TWh. By 2050, it represents 24.6\% of the total electricity production which is less than the current share of conventional nuclear in Belgium, 38.5\%. This resurgence of nuclear electricity occurs at the expense of other, although more efficient technologies: \gls{CCGT} and industrial \gls{CHP}. Besides the unchanged end-use-demand, we observe a slight increase of the electrification of the rest of the system: +9.4\% which corresponds to +5.8\,TWh, mostly consumed by electric heaters in industry (+48\%) to produce industrial high-temperature heat.

\label{fig:results_deter_layer_elec}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{System-level impacts}
\label{subsubsec:results_deter_overall}
First of all, as far as the objective function (\ie the total transition cost) is concerned, \Cref{fig:results_deter_overall_emissions_sector} shows that the 6\,GW \gls{SMR} installed from 2040 allow reaching a 3.3\% (-36.9\,b€, $\sim$\,6\% of the Belgian GDP) cheaper overall transition. Interestingly, as the model can freely spend the constrained \ce{CO2}-budget over the transition, knowing ahead (\ie perfect foresight) that cheaper and low-emitting \gls{SMR} will be available in the future, cost-savings, that are more important after 2040, also occur before 2040. This is mostly due to the extended use of cheaper \gls{LFO} at the beginning of the transition to produce \gls{HVC}, that is then compensated by the deployment of \gls{SMR} (\Cref{fig:results_deter_overall_emissions_sector}). Then, the capital-intensive investments in \gls{SMR}, mostly recovered by the end of the transition as salvage value, are widely compensated by the smaller resource-related OPEX. This leads, at the end, aggregating the OPEX and the annualised CAPEX, to a system that is yearly 8.8\% less expensive by 2050.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

(Right) Emissions per energy sector differerence between the SMR and the REF cases. The deployment of \gls{SMR} from 2040 onward allows maintaining longer the use of \acrfull{LFO} for the production of \acrfull{HVC}.}
\label{fig:results_deter_overall_emissions_sector}
\end{figure}

Then, considering the primary energy mix shown in \Cref{fig:results_deter_energy_mix}, three phases in the transition can be identified. Before 2040, thanks to the perfect foresight approach, the model finds it more economical in 2025 to keep on using 33.2\,TWh of \gls{LFO} to produce \gls{HVC} through naphtha/LPG-cracking. In 2040, uranium-driven \gls{SMR} substitutes the electricity originally produced from industrial \gls{CHP} and \gls{CCGT} running respectively on fossil gas and renewable ammonia. Finally, from 2045 onward, the significant drop in the consumption of electrofuels comes from the same industrial \gls{CHP}. This is the illustration of the atom-molecules dilemma where the consumption of local renewables is, on its side, not much affected. In other words, \gls{SMR} competes with importing electrofuels while both support the integration of local solar and wind energies. Then, like the power sector, the SMR case ends up in a less efficient whole-energy system by 2050 at it consumes 47\,TWh (+12.7\%) primary energy more to supply an unchanged \gls{EUD}. Interestingly, in both cases, given the assumptions made on the \gls{GWP} of the resources (\ie $\mathit{gwp}_{\mathrm{op,electrofuels}}=0$\,kt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/GWh and $\mathit{gwp}_{\mathrm{op,uranium}}=0.004$\,kt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/GWh), the constraint on the \ce{CO2}-budget leads to ``carbon-neutrality'' by 2050\footnote{The model being constrained to keep on using all the waste that would keep on being locally produced, the system in 2050 reaches a $\sim 3.5\,Mt_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/year.}.

In Uranium, considered as a non-renewable resource in line with \citet{rixhon2021terminology}, is nevertheless dissociated from other non-renewable resources for the sake of clarity. The imported electricity is split between imported non-renewable and renewable resources assuming a linear decrease between the current share of renewables, \ie 37.41\% \cite{eurostat_share_re_elec}, and an assumed 100\%-renewable European electricity mix by 2050.}
\label{fig:results_deter_energy_mix}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Non-power sectors}
\label{subsubsec:results_deter_others}
\paragraph*{High-temperature heat}
As aforementioned, the main impact of including \gls{SMR} from 2040 onward on the high-temperature heat sector is (i) its higher direct electrification and (ii) the reduction of overall more efficient heat-and-power co-generation in the benefit of single-output industrial boilers. On the one hand, in the REF case, industrial electric heaters are mainly used to absorb, instead of curtailing, the ``over-production" of the 59\,GW solar-PV when fully deployed, in the sunny days. With \gls{SMR}, by 2050, an additional 1.7\,GW (+13\%) of these heaters can rely on a more constant supply of defossilised electricity, consequently increasing their load factor and yearly production respectively by 31\% and 48\%. On the other hand, given the 44.6\,TWh of electricity produced by \gls{SMR}, cogeneration units are less relevant and, by 2050, 2.6\,GW industrial gas boilers completely substitute \gls{CHP} to produce 16.6\,TWh (\ie 23\%) of the total production of high-temperature heat.

\paragraph*{Low-temperature heat}
This sector is marginally impacted. In both cases, the major shift of supply from decentralised to centralised productions operates early in the transition, to hit the constraint that \gls{DHN} cannot supply more than 37\% of the \gls{LT}-heat production. Then, from a mix between oil (53\%), gas (43\%) and wood (4\%) boilers for the decentralised production of \gls{LT}-heat in 2020, the system progressively shifts towards electric \gls{HP} only. Similarly for the centralised production of \gls{LT}-heat, electric \gls{HP} remains the most efficient and economic option.

\paragraph*{Mobility}
The passenger mobility is not affected either as the electrification of the system is preferentially done in this sector with \gls{BEV} progressively substituting \gls{ICE} cars for the private sector. About the public mobility, trains and tramways supply their \textit{a priori} set maximum share, respectively, 50\% and 30\% complemented by \gls{CNG} buses substituting diesel-driven buses. Similarly, considering the freight transport, technology shifts (\ie from diesel to \gls{FC} trucks) or modal shares (\ie 53\%-47\% split between \gls{NG} and (bio)-diesel boats) are identical between the two cases.

\paragraph*{Non-energy demand}
The supply of ammonia (\ie from Haber-Bosch to direct import of renewable ammonia) and methanol (\ie import of renewable methanol) are unchanged between the two cases. However, as introduced previously, to produce \gls{HVC}, the full substitution of naphtha/LPG-cracking by \gls{MTO} is delayed as the emissions of the former are compensated by the later integration of \gls{SMR}.

\subsection{Uncertainty quantification on the cost, the atom and the molecules}
\label{subsec:results_uq}
``\textit{It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.}" (Niels Bohr, foundational contributor to the understanding of atomic structure and quantum theory). Besides the deep understanding of the deterministic results, it is important to challenge these conclusions out-of-sample, accounting for the uncertainty of the parameters. To mitigate the computational burden, we have used the \gls{PCE} approach (\Cref{subsec:meth:UQ}) on the monthly version of EnergyScope Pathway. As detailed by \citet{limpens2023pathway}, this simplified model does not implement daily storage technologies and integrates much more easily intermittent renewables (PVs and wind turbines) in the system as the daily supply-demand intermittency and mismatch are not at stake. Consequently, it requires less flexibility options (\ie electrification of the heating sector or import of electricity from the neighbouring countries) and ends up with a cheaper transition (-3\%). Although, it allows to quantify the full set of 34 uncertain parameters (\ie 1260 samples for an order-2 \gls{PCE}), and avoid the computational burden of the hourly pathway. Nevertheless, comparing the \gls{UQ} on the hourly pathway with a limited set of uncertain parameters and on the monthly model, Appendix \ref{app:UQ_transition_cost} shows that the most impacting parameters are correctly captured by the latter.

After briefly assessing the \gls{GSA} on the objective function of the model, the total transition cost, this section investigates more deeply the atom-molecules dilemma. This time, the Sobol' indices are computed for import of renewable molecules and installed capacities of \gls{SMR}.

\subsubsection{Total transition cost}
\label{subsubsec:results_uq_cost}
Exhaustively listed in Appendix \ref{app:UQ_transition_cost}, \Cref{tab:UQ_short} gathers the most impacting parameters\footnote{Per \citet{Turati2017}, parameters are considered as ``impacting'' if their Sobol' index is above the threshold $=1/d$, $d$ being the total number of uncertain parameters after the pre-selection phase. In this case, $d=34$, and, consequently, the threshold is equal to 2.9\%.} on the total transition cost, highlighting the cost of purchasing electrofuels as well as the potentiality to install \gls{SMR} and its CAPEX. The former is the most impacting parameter whereas the two others have much lower influence on the variation of the total transition cost. Given the uncertainty characterisation presented in Section \ref{subsubsec:UQ:UC}, there are 60\% chance that no \gls{SMR} could be installed. In other words, the variation of the parameter $f_{\mathrm{max,SMR}}$ has zero impact on the variation of the total transition cost in 60\% of the samples. Then, in perspective with the local sensitivity analysis of Section \ref{subsec:results_deter}, the 3.3\% reduction has been observed when \gls{SMR} is installed from 2040 onward. This represents only 10\% of the samples. Moreover, given its characteristics detailed in \Cref{tab:SMR_features}, mostly its cheap and low-emitting fuel (\ie uranium) and the long lifetime leading to lower annualised CAPEX and higher salvage value, this explains why \gls{SMR} has this lower impact. On the contrary, more expensive renewable electrofuels are always imported, to a smaller or larger extent depending on the sample. For instance, in the REF case (Section \ref{subsubsec:results_deter_overall}), the imported electrofuels represent, by 2050, 152.9\,TWh (\ie 41\% of the primary energy mix) with an average 93€/MWh cost of purchasing and, over the entire transition, a 273\,b€ cumulative OPEX (\ie 25\% of the total transition cost).

\begin{table}[htbp!]
\caption{Total Sobol' indices of the uncertain parameters over the total transition cost. Where the cost of purchasing electrofuels is the top-1 parameter, \gls{SMR}-related parameters have a negligigble impact on this cost.}
\label{tab:UQ_short}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l c c}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter}  & \textbf{Ranking} & \textbf{Sobol' index} \\	
\midrule
\textbf{Purchase electrofuels} & 1 & 47.4\% \\
Industry EUD & 2 & 23.5\% \\
Interest rate & 3 & 11.0\% \\
Purchase fossil fuels  & 4 & 6.9\% \\
$\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$\\
\textbf{Potential capacity \gls{SMR}} & 11 & 0.9\% \\
$\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$\\
\textbf{CAPEX \gls{SMR}} & 32 & $<$0.1\% \\
\bottomrule							

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Given the relatively wide uncertainty range (\ie up to [-30.8\%; +24.0\%] by 2050) and, above all, the major share among the total demand, between 53\% and 60\%, the industrial \gls{EUD} is the second most impacting parameter. Then, as the driving factor for the annualisation and the salvage value of the assets, the interest rate has a 11\% Sobol' index\footnote{It is important to note here that the model considers an overall interest rate for the entire system (\ie 1.5\% as a nominal value). In practice, the interest rate would vary depending on the technology investment risk. This variation would have, for instance, a major impact on the \gls{LCOE} of technologies like nuclear power plants \cite{world_nuclear_asso}, given the important capital needs and long time horizons \cite{IEA_Nuclear_2019}.}. Finally, similarly to electrofuels, the cost of purchasing fossil fuels is also to consider in the perspective to reduce the uncertainty over the total transition cost. However, due to the ambitious \ce{CO2}-budget, phasing out of fossil fuels is urgent and makes their uncertain impact smaller than their renewable alternatives.

\subsubsection{Atom and molecules}
The samples used to carry out the \gls{GSA} on the total transition cost, also provide the distribution of other outputs of the model. Among them, \Cref{fig:results_uq_electrofuels} shows the evolution of the import of renewable electrofuels over the transition.

As the general trends are increasing, discrepancies exist between the different energy carriers. E-methane, as the renewable alternative to fossil natural gas, substitutes it, sometimes at a very early stage of the transition, 2025, and to a somehow unrealistically large extent, 173\,TWh, which is more than 13\% more than the total import of electrofuels in the REF case. The necessity to import this molecule is progressive through the transition to supply mostly industrial \gls{CHP} and boilers. 

E-hydrogen becomes rapidly the main stream of hydrogen in the system, on top of steam-methane-reforming or electrolysis, to reach a median and a maximum values of, respectively 13.6\,TWh and 40.7\,TWh in 2050. Hydrogen is more frequently used in the mobility sector. Like in the REF case, fuel cell trucks are often the first option but, in some outlying cases, fuel cell cars and buses appear to completely substitute respectively \gls{BEV} cars and \gls{CNG} buses by 2050. Moreover, some samples lead to local production of methanol via the methanolation process, to produce up to 16.3\,TWh of methanol (\ie 30\% of the total supply of methanol of the nominal REF and SMR cases). 

Then, the imported e-ammonia, becoming rapidly cost-competitive against its fossil alternative (\Cref{fig:cs_resources_cost}), quickly substitutes it and the Haber-Bosch process. Where the initial purpose of ammonia is to satisfy a relatively limited \acrfull{NED} (\ie 10 $\pm$ 3\,TWh by 2050), the variation of its import is mostly due to the higher or lower need for ammonia-\gls{CCGT} as a flexible option to produce electricity. From 2035, out of the four considered electrofuels, the imported e-ammonia is the one exhibiting the largest uncertainty with, for instance, an interquartile range (IQR)\footnote{The interquartile range is the difference between the third quartile ($Q3$ or $P_{75}$) and the first ($Q1$ or $P_{25}$). It is an indicator of statistical dispersion around the median, $Q2$ or $P_{50}$.} of about 50\,TWh. In some extreme cases, e-ammonia is the most imported molecules, \ie up to 233\,TWh or 63\% of the total primary mix in the REF case in 2050. 

Likewise, e-methanol early becomes the selected option to supply methanol even though alternatives like biomass-to-methanol or synthetic methanolation exist in some outlying cases. Given its lower \gls{NED} (\ie 1.5$\pm$0.5\,TWh$_{\text{NED,methanol}}$ by 2050), the variation of imported e-methanol is almost exclusively due to its role in the industrial production of \gls{HVC}, \ie 78\% of the total \gls{NED}, through the \acrfull{MTO} process. In some rare samples, methanol is also used to supply the freight transport sector via boats or trucks.

Appendix \ref{app:UQ_electrofuels} gives a more detailed information. On the one hand, it compares the statistics (\ie quartiles and median) with the quantity of imported electrofuels in the REF and SMR cases. On the other hand, this appendix shows the distributions of the different sources of supply and consumption of gas, hydrogen, ammonia and methanol.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

\caption{Distribution of the imported renewable electrofuels over the transition. Starting from no electrofuel in 2020, their respective import rises progressively along the transition (\ie increasing median) at different growth rates and with different ranges of values.

\label{fig:results_uq_electrofuels}
\end{figure}

After investigating the distribution of imports of electrofuels over the transition, this part assesses the space of uncertainties, like \citet{pickering2022diversity} who investigated the space of feasibility to reach carbon neutrality in Europe. \Cref{fig:results_uq_samples} gives the trend lines of the key parameters for these imports in 2050\footnote{The authors picked this specific year as it is the one where electrofuels, if imported, are imported in the largest amount, in general, compared to the other years of the transiton.}, as well the installed capacities of \gls{SMR}. Next to the name of a parameter, one can read its Sobol' index versus the output of interest\footnote{For these outputs of interest, different from the total transition cost, the \gls{LOO} error is generally higher than the threshold of \SI{1}{\%} defined in Section \ref{subsubsec:UQ:PCE}. Consequently, the Sobol' indices are less accurate but already allow a fair relative comparison between the different parameters.}. Box plots also point out the distribution of this output for the extreme low or high values of some parameters.

As aforementioned, the industrial \gls{EUD} impacts the most the import of e-methane. This parameter directly dictates the demand of industrial high-temperature heat for which industrial gas \gls{CHP}, and industrial gas boilers to a lower extent, represent, on average over all the samples, respectively 25.6\% and 6.1\% of the total production. Then, considering the smaller-impact parameters, we notice that \gls{SMR} plays a non-negligible role. Indeed, if deployed, \gls{SMR} produces abundant low-emitting electricity for industrial electric heaters that substitute, even completely in some cases, gas alternatives. This confirms the observation made in Section \ref{subsubsec:results_deter_others}. Highly available local biomass also leads to smaller import of e-methane to supply bio-hydrolysis and produce methane-equivalent gas. Finally and surprisingly, costs of purchasing electrofuels and fossil fuels have a positive and negative correlation with the amount of e-methane, respectively. In other words, by 2050, more expensive electrofuels induce to more e-methane import and \textit{vice versa} for the fossil fuels. Given the techno-economic optimum sought by EnergyScope, if electrofuels are more expensive, the system will, overall, import less of them, especially e-ammonia, mainly used by \gls{CCGT}. Subject to the \ce{CO2}-budget for the transition, the system goes towards more efficient technologies, like industrial methane-\gls{CHP} to substitute e-ammonia-\gls{CCGT} in the production of electricity. First running on fossil natural gas, these \gls{CHP} consume more e-methane by 2050. In the contrary, if electrofuels are cheaper, there is more import of them, and especially of e-ammonia. This leaves room for more emitting and cheaper resources to be used while respecting the \ce{CO2}-budget, \ie coal in industrial boilers that produce, in these cases, on average 24\% of the high-temperature (HT) heat in 2050. Consequently, there is smaller investment in methane \gls{CHP}, and consequently import of e-methane as more abundant renewable electricity is produced via e-ammonia-\gls{CCGT} and more HT-heat is supplied by industrial coal boilers. About the cost of purchasing fossil fuels, the parameter has mainly an impact on the import of fossil \gls{NG} as the most versatile energy carrier in the whole-energy system. If \gls{NG} is more expensive, the system will import less of it. Subsequently, the investments in methane-\gls{CHP} and boilers are more limited. This ends up in smaller need for e-methane by 2050.

In relation to e-hydrogen, the sensitivity analysis highlights its dependence on various driving parameters, particularly those linked to the transport sector. As depicted in \Cref{fig:results_uq_prod_cons} in Appendix \ref{app:UQ_electrofuels}, the utilisation of e-hydrogen is most prevalent in \gls{FC} trucks, followed by \gls{FC} cars and buses to a lesser extent. The adoption of fuel cell engines in trucks contributes, on average, to 63.5\% of the total road freight transport, thereby affecting the level of e-hydrogen imports. Consequently, the smaller is the CAPEX of fuel cell engines, the more the system imports e-hydrogen. Similarly, the cost of purchasing electrofuels influences e-hydrogen imports. Subsequently, the cost of purchasing biofuels emerges as the third most influential parameter. Indeed, biodiesel trucks are the mostly picked alternative to \gls{FC} trucks to provide, on average, 27.6\% of the total. Additionally, \gls{CNG} buses are preferred in public road transport (34.9\%), followed by \gls{FC} buses (11.2\%) competing with biodiesel and hybrid biodiesel buses, accounting for 27.8\% and 26.1\%, respectively. Finally, the last noticeable parameter at stake is the CAPEX of electric vehicles. In competition with \gls{BEV} that stand for 83.4\% on average of the private mobility sector, the cheaper these cars are, the more cost-competitive are these vehicles, and vice versa, versus \gls{FC} cars (\ie 13.7\% of the total passenger mobility, on average).

As already pointed out in Section \ref{subsubsec:results_deter_power_sector}, the installation of \gls{SMR} drastically reduces the import of e-ammonia. As ammonia \gls{CCGT} is the biggest consumer of ammonia by the end of the transition, low-emitting and cheap electricity flexibly produced by \gls{SMR} substitutes the \gls{CCGT}. With a higher cost of purchasing electrofuels, this import of e-ammonia drops down to 7.3\,TWh, 83.4\% less than in the REF case. Then, with a 9\%-Sobol' index, industrial \gls{EUD} also influences the need for this molecule, due to its \gls{NED}.

The conclusions are more straightforward for the import of e-methanol and the installed capacity of \gls{SMR}. For the former, industrial \gls{EUD} is, by far (\ie 81\% Sobol' index), the key factor. Due to its own \gls{NED} but, above all, since it is the low-emitting alternative picked by the model to supply the significant \gls{NED} of \gls{HVC}, the lower this demand, the lower the need to import e-methanol, and vice versa. For the latter, it is the availability of the technology that drives its installation. Not shown here but all the samples of the \gls{GSA} highlight that \gls{SMR} is installed to its maximum capacity, \ie 6\,GW, as soon as possible. In other words, the only parameter ``Potential capacity \gls{SMR}'' dictates the installation of this technology\footnote{In practice, we observe that as soon as this parameter is equal or higher than 0.9, 0.8 and 0.6, 6\,GW \gls{SMR} is installed from, respectively, 2040, 2045 and 2050.}. Surprisingly, the [-40\%; +44\%]  variation of its CAPEX has a negligible impact, with a Sobol' index of 0.9\%.

The grey dashed line gives the value of the output of interest in the REF case.}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Local renewables}
In line with results given in Section \ref{subsec:results_deter}, the \gls{GSA} shows that \gls{SMR} has negligible impact on the deployment of local \gls{VRES} (\ie \gls{PV}, onshore and offshore wind turbines). \Cref{fig:results_uq_pdf_local_ren} gives the evolution of Sobol' indices for the most impacting parameters on the deployment of \gls{PV} and offshore wind\footnote{As the installed capacities of onshore wind is totally driven by the uncertainty on its maximum potential, $f_{\mathrm{max,windon}}$, it is not represented in the figure.}. The key factor that drives the installed capacities of these two technologies is mostly their respective maximum potential, especially at the end of the transition, much more than their CAPEX. Given its higher \gls{LCOE} (\Cref{fig:LCOE}), \gls{PV} is more impacted in the short-term by the variation on the cost of purchasing electrofuels supplying e-methane (and e-ammonia to a lesser extent) \gls{CCGT}. However, this impact gets negligible by 2050.

    \item Given its lower \gls{LCOE}, \gls{SMR} is installed as soon as available. It directly substitutes other flexible power generation units (\ie CCGT) and provides, by 2050, 44.6\,TWh, 25\% of the total electricity production. Consequently, this  reduces the need to produce electricity via \gls{CHP} and allows increasing by 48\% the high-temperature heat produced by electric heaters. Besides these two sectors, the others (\ie low-temperature heat, mobility and non-energy demand) are marginally or not impacted by the integration of \gls{SMR}.
    \item Betting on \gls{SMR} means letting the emissions go up at early stages of the transition (\ie \gls{LFO} still used in 2025 to produce \gls{HVC}) to end up with an overall transition and system by 2050 that are respectively 3.3\% and 8.8\% cheaper than the REF case. 
    \item Given the ambitious \ce{CO2}-budget (\ie 30-year budget representing 10 years of the current emissions), \acrfull{GSA} highlights the biggest impact of the cost of purchasing electrofuels on the variation of the total transition cost, around 45\%. On the contrary, parameters directly related to \gls{SMR} (\ie its availability and its CAPEX) have limited impact, below 1\%.
    \item Finally, the same \gls{GSA} points out the key drivers for the import of renewable electrofuels and the installation of \gls{SMR} by 2050. Besides the cost of purchasing electrofuels (\ie the lower this cost, the bigger the imports), it shows that available \gls{SMR} would have mainly a direct impact on e-ammonia, by substituting the ammonia \gls{CCGT} that is the biggest consumer of this molecule. Indirectly, this parameter will also reduce the import of e-methane by reducing the need for gas \gls{CHP} and gas boilers. About e-hydrogen and e-methanol, their imports are impacted by the other technologies in competition in the transport sector and the industrial demand, respectively.
    \item ``In other words, \gls{SMR} competes with importing electrofuels while both support the integration of local solar and wind energies.'' from Section \ref{subsubsec:results_deter_overall}

Parier sur l'arrivée du \gls{SMR} peut être considéré comme une fuite vers l'avant quant à l'abandon des ressources fossiles, (to a lesser extent) mais ne touche pas (ou presque) au déploiement du renouvelable local, vers moins de sector coupling (moins de CHP), Less efficiency

A significant decrease on the demand-side is probably one of the cornerstones of the energy transition \cite{millward2020providing, contino_sobriety}.

\section{Belgian energy system in 2020}
\label{sec:app:bel_2020}The Belgian whole-energy system of 2020 was largely based (88.6\% of the primary energy mix) on \og conventional fuels\fg (\ie oil and oil products (38.2\%), natural gas (29.5\%), uranium (16.3\%) and solid fossil fuels (4.6\%) while the rest mainly accounts for 26.7\,TWh of lignocellulosic and wet biomass, 12.8\,TWh of wind and 5.1\,TWh of solar \cite{spf_economy_2022}. Given the data available in the literature (mostly for the power sector) and, when not available, following the assumptions made by \citet{Limpens2020}, \Cref{tab:Belgium_2020} gives the major technologies used in 2020 to supply the different demands of \Cref{fig:cs_demands}.

\section{Uncertainty characterisation} 
\label{app:UC_full}
Table \ref{tab:UC_full} summarises the uncertainty ranges for the different groups of technologies and resources, for the year 2025. Refer to \cite{Moret2017, Moret2017PhDThesis} for the methodology and sources. As the model optimises the system every 5 years, $N=5$ has been selected to get the final ranges of uncertainties of type II and III, based on the work of \citet{Moret2017PhDThesis}. For type III uncertainties (\ie uncertainty ranges increasing with time), a 50\% increase has been set arbitrarily between the ranges for 2025 and these same ranges for 2050. In other words, for these specific uncertainties, the ranges for 2050 are 50\% larger than for 2025.

\citet{rixhon2021role} analysed the impact of these parameters on the total cost of the snapshot Belgian whole-energy system in 2050 subject to different \gls{GWP} limits. Based on this work, we have selected a subset of impacting uncertainties, added others due to the pathway formulation (\eg $\Delta_{\mathrm{change,pass}}$), and listed them in Table \ref{tab:UC_full}. The uncertainty characterisation gives the uncertainty ranges per parameter or group of parameters (category).

This work considers nine groups of uncertain parameters: (i) the cost of purchasing imported energy carriers; (ii) the investment cost (\ie CAPEX) of some technologies, mostly related to the mobility sector and the integration of renewables; (iii) the maintenance cost (\ie OPEX) of every technology; (iv) the consumption of electric and fuel cells vehicles in the mobility sector; (v) the potential installed capacity of renewables; (vi) the hourly load factor of renewables accounting for variability of solar irradiance or wind speed; (vii) the availability of resources considered as limited (\ie biomass and electricity); (viii) the end-use-demands split per sector of activities (\ie households, services, passenger mobility and industry) and (ix) other parameters like the interest rate or the modal share change in different key sectors. For the specific case of \gls{SMR}, the parameter $f_{\mathrm{max,SMR}}$ will influence the maximum capacity (\ie 6~GW) to install to translate somehow the readiness of this technology. If it is (i) smaller than 0.6, there is no possibility to install \gls{SMR} during the transition; (ii) between 0.6 and 0.8, these 6~GW can be installed only in 2050; (iii) between 0.8 and 0.9, these can be installed from 2045 onward and; (iv) higher than 0.9, the prescribed maximum capacity can be installed from 2040 onward.

\section{Uncertainty quantification}
\label{app:UQ}
\subsection{Total transition cost}
\label{app:UQ_transition_cost}

\Cref{fig:UQ_PDF_total_transition_cost} shows the \gls{PDF} of the total transition cost given the 1260 samples. Stretching between 680\,b€ and 1940\,b€, the mean, the median and the nominal value (\ie REF case) are close to each other, respectively 1160\,b€, 1150\,b€ and 1080\,b€. Similarly to the analysis carried out by \citet{coppitters2023optimizing}, one observes here that the distribution is right-skewed. It could then be qualified as ``fragile" as the top 50\% of the samples cover a bigger range (\ie between 1150 and 1940) than the bottom 50\% of the samples (\ie between 680 and 1150). In other words, the bad scenarios, resulting in a total transition cost higher than the median, have a bigger effect on this cost.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/UQ_PDF_total_transition_cost.pdf}
\caption{\acrfull{PDF} of the total transition cost. The mean, $\mu=1.16\cdot10^3$\,b€, is slightly higher than the median ($P_{50}=1.15\cdot10^3$\,b€) and the nominal cases cost, $1.08\cdot10^3$\,b€ and $1.04\cdot10^3$\,b€ respectively for the REF and SMR cases. Also, with a standard deviation, $\sigma=185$\,b€, a 95\%-confidence interval would be about [0.8; 1.5]$\cdot10^3$\,b€.}
\label{fig:UQ_PDF_total_transition_cost}
\end{figure}

\Cref{tab:UQ_full} gives the ranking and total Sobol index over the total transition cost of each of the 34 parameters listed in \Cref{tab:UC_full}. The first column shows these indicators for the \gls{GSA} applied on the monthly pathway model that has some limitations \cite{limpens2023pathway} but has the main advantage to run much faster. The second column gives the same indicators but for an uncertainty quantification carried out on the hourly pathway model and only using the most impacting parameters. Given the similar rankings of the parameters between these two, this comparison shows that the monthly model can be a computationally efficient proxy to quantify the uncertainties of the actual hourly model and point out the key parameters on optimisation-driving objective, the total transition cost. 

Besides the top-4 parameters, rankings are slightly different. However, this does not jeopardize the comparative analysis given the similar Sobol' indices. Given their wide range of uncertainty [-64.3\%; 179.8\%] and their significant role to meet the \ce{CO2}-budget, the cost of purchasing electrofuels is the first, by far, impacting parameter. Next, comes, naturally, the industrial \gls{EUD}, representing, at the nominal value, 60\% of the total demands by 2050. The top-3 is completed by the variation of the interest rate, directly impacting the annualisation and the salvage values of the assets. Finally, since the current Belgian whole-energy system deeply relies on fossil resources, and would still do in the near future, the cost of purchasing fossil fuels is part of the impacting parameters. On the contrary, due to the very low annualised, cost, long lifetime leading to a significant salvage value  and a low-emitting fuel, the parameters related to \gls{SMR} barely impact the total transition cost.

\Cref{fig:results_uq_prod_cons} gives the distribution of the different routes of supply and consumption of gas like methane, hydrogen, ammonia and methanol, resulting from the 1260 samples of the \gls{GSA}.

Given its lower cost of purchasing than its renewable equivalent (\Cref{fig:cs_resources_cost}) and lower \gls{GWP} than other fossil fuels (\ie $\mathit{gwp}_{\mathrm{op,NG}}=0.27$\,kt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/GWh versus $\mathit{gwp}_{\mathrm{op,LFO}}=0.31$\,kt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/GWh or $\mathit{gwp}_{\mathrm{op,coal}}=0.40$\,kt$_{\ce{CO2},\text{eq}}$/GWh), fossil \gls{NG} remains the main source of gas in the system until 2040. Besides bio-hydrolisis as the main consumer of wet biomass to consistently produce gas, e-methane eventually substitutes fossil natural gas by 2045-2050 in order to respect the \ce{CO2}-budget for the transition. Its versatility makes gas used by a wide variety of technologies in the different sectors. Initially, in 2020, decentralised gas boilers, \gls{CCGT} and industrial gas boilers represent the biggest consumers of gas with 39\%, 21\% and 16\% of the total consumption, respectively. Progressively, in line with the rest of the system shifting towards more efficiency in the mid-term, industrial \gls{CHP} represent the lion's share, next to other usages in the transport or \gls{LT}-heating sectors.

On the contrary, import of fossil-based hydrogen, largely produced from steam-methane-reforming \cite{spf_economie_h2}, is rarely part of the solution due to the emissions related to the consumption of natural gas. E-hydrogen is the consistent source of hydrogen in the system, next to local production (\ie steam-methane-reforming, electrolysis or ammonia-cracking) in some rare cases where low industrial \gls{EUD} coincides with more abundant electricity from \gls{SMR} or \gls{PV}. In terms of consumption, \gls{FC}-trucks are the more consistent player. \gls{FC}-cars are also at stake but in specific cases where their CAPEX and the CAPEX of electric vehicles are in the bottom and the top of their respective uncertainty range.

Becoming cheaper than its fossil equivalent at early stages of the transition (\ie from 2030 onward), e-ammonia is the exclusive stream of ammonia in the system, except rare cases. Then, on top of its consistent \gls{NED}, the largest consumption of ammonia is \gls{CCGT} as flexible power generation units, to substitute their e-methane equivalents that have a higher \gls{LCOE} (\Cref{fig:LCOE}).

Similarly to ammonia, on top of local production in rare cases, e-methanol is the key source for methanol. Besides its own \gls{NED}, methanol is mostly consumed to produce \gls{HVC} via the \gls{MTO} process instead of naphtha-cracking, in order to respect to \ce{CO2}-budget for the transition.

\section{\ce{CO2}-budget versus linear decrease of emissions}
\label{app:CO2}
\Cref{fig:app_CO2_REF_lin} shows the yearly emissions attributed for each sector in the REF case (\ie imposed \ce{CO2}-budget) and a case where the \ce{CO2}-trajectory is constrained instead. Interestingly, these two transition pathways end up in a similar carbon-neutral whole-energy system in 2050. The two main sectors that significantly reduce their emissions in the REF case are the production of \gls{HVC} and the high-temperature heat. In the former, this is linked to the extended use of oil products through naphtha-cracking. The latter is produced by industrial coal boilers for longer, until 2040. Overall, ending up to the same level of emissions in 2050, the REF case represents a 60\% reduction of the cumulative emissions compared to the linear decrease, for a 7.5\% more expensive transition.
